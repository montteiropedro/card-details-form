## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I went with HTML, CSS and Javascript, so I can revise my knowleadgement and improve it more.

### Continued development

I think this was the first time that I really took some time to use only HTML, CSS and Javascript for some custom validations. During the project I could notice that I was lacking some knowleadge in this area so I'm really satisfied that a went with HTML, CSS and Javascript in this project. Now the focus is to cotinue learning more and more about validations.
